# Project 27 - Ensuring Operational Excellence with IoT Monitoring at EpicReads

In this project, you will develop robust monitoring system to detect anomalies, identify potential issues, and notify the operations team before disruptions occur using IoT device.

## Building an IoT Anomaly Detection System for EpicReads’ Printing Machines

As a Cloud Engineer, you’ll develop a real-time monitoring system that identifies anomalies based on machine-specific thresholds, generates actionable insights, &amp; sends alerts to the operations team. This assignment will enable you to design an IoT-based anomaly detection system using AWS services.

## Building the Printer Anomalies Dashboard Visualizer

The goal of this assignment is to develop an interactive Printer Dashboard Visualizer, a web application that provides real-time insights into the performance of IoT-enabled printers at EpicReads. The dashboard will leverage AWS backend services and visualize critical metrics.
